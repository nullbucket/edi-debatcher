# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

This is a work in progress. Two useful sources seem to be:
  * [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/)
  * [Contributer Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Work in progress. Right now, wearing pants at work is a good start. If you are remote and not wearing pants, we should have no idea, don't want to know.

## Attribution
